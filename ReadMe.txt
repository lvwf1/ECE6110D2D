This is ECE-6110-QSZ CAD Communication Network final project submission.
Our group members are Mengya Gao, Zhengfu Li, Weifeng Lyu

Our submission includes codes, final paper report, environment attribute table, graphics generated by Python and PyViz.

HVT_WithoutD2D.cc is C++ network simulation running without D2D communication
HVT_WithD2D.cc is C++ network simulation running with D2D communication

The command running two programs with default attributes under ../ns-3-dev# folder are:
./waf --run scratch/HVT_WithoutD2D
./waf --run scratch/HVT_WithD2D

HighVolumeTrafficWithD2D_PyViz.PNG and HighVolumeTrafficWithoutD2D_PyViz.PNG are two visualizations models, with and without D2D communication run by PyViz Module.
The code will generate 4 graphics (DelaySum Versus MaxPacket.png, DelaySum Versus SimulationTime.png, Throughput Versus MaxPacket.png, Throughput Versus SimulationTime.png) about our simulation result after collecting raw data output.
